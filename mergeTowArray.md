# Merge Two Sorted Arrays

This Java program merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

## How It Works:
- Takes two sorted arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`).
- Merges them while maintaining sorted order.
- Stores the result in `nums1`.

## Usage:
Run the program in Java:
```java
javac mergeTowArray.java
java mergeTowArray


nums1 = {-5, -2, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0};
nums2 = {-3, 1, 8};


nums1[] = -5 -3 -2 1 4 5 8
